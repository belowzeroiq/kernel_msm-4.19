Binding for TI bq25150 500-mA Linear charger

The BQ25150 is a highly integrated battery charge management IC that integrates
the most common functions for wearable devices, namely a charger, an
output voltage rail, ADC for battery and system monitoring, and
push-button controller.

Required Properties:
	- compatible = Should contain "ti,bq25150"
	- reg: int I2c address 0x6b
	- #address-cells: 1;
	- #size-cells: = 0;

Optional Properties:
	- ti,battery-regulation-voltage: integer, maximum charging voltage in uV.
	- ti,charge-current: integer, maximum charging current in uA.
	- reset-gpios: GPIO used for Master reset
	- low-power-gpios: GPIO used for low power mode of IC.
	- pg-gpios: GPIO used for connecting the bq2425x device PG (Power Good) pin.
	    This pin is not available on all devices however it should be used if
	    possible as this is the recommended way to obtain the charger's input PG
	    state. If this pin is not specified a software-based approach for PG
	    detection is used.

Example
bq25150@6b {
	compatible = "ti,bq25150";
	reg = <0x6b>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	ti,charge-current = <0x0>;
	ti,battery-regulation-voltage = <0x0>;
};
