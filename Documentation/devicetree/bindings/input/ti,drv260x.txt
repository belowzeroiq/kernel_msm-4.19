Texas Instruments - drv260x Haptics driver family

The drv260x family serial control bus communicates through I2C protocols

Required properties:
	- compatible - One of:
		"ti,drv2604" - DRV2604
		"ti,drv2605" - DRV2605
		"ti,drv2605l" - DRV2605L
	- reg -  I2C slave address
	- supply- Required supply regulators are:
		"vbat" - battery voltage
	- mode - Power up mode of the chip (defined in include/dt-bindings/input/ti-drv260x.h)
		DRV260X_LRA_MODE - Linear Resonance Actuator mode (Piezoelectric)
		DRV260X_LRA_NO_CAL_MODE - This is a LRA Mode but there is no calibration
				sequence during init.  And the device is configured for real
				time playback mode (RTP mode).
		DRV260X_ERM_MODE - Eccentric Rotating Mass mode (Rotary vibrator)
	- library-sel - These are ROM based waveforms pre-programmed into the IC.
				This should be set to set the library to use at power up.
				(defined in include/dt-bindings/input/ti-drv260x.h)
		DRV260X_LIB_A - Pre-programmed Library
		DRV260X_LIB_B - Pre-programmed Library
		DRV260X_LIB_C - Pre-programmed Library
		DRV260X_LIB_D - Pre-programmed Library
		DRV260X_LIB_E - Pre-programmed Library
		DRV260X_LIB_F - Pre-programmed Library

Optional properties:
	- enable-gpio - gpio pin to enable/disable the device.
	- vib_rated_voltage - The rated voltage of the actuator in millivolts.
			  If this is not set then the value will be defaulted to
			  3.2 v.
	- vib_overdrive_voltage - The overdrive voltage of the actuator in millivolts.
			  If this is not set then the value will be defaulted to
			  3.2 v.
Example:

drv2605l: drv2605l@5a {
		compatible = "ti,drv2605l";
		reg = <0x5a>;
		enable-gpio = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		mode = <DRV260X_LRA_MODE>;
		library-sel = <DRV260X_LIB_SEL_DEFAULT>;
		vib-rated-voltage = <3200>;
		vib-overdriver-voltage = <3200>;
};
