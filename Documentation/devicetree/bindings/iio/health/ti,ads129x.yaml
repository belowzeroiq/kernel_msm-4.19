description: |
  The ADS129x and ADS129xR incorporate all of the features that are commonly
  required in medical electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG)
  applications. With high levels of integration and exceptional performance,
  the ADS129x and ADS129xR enables the development of scalable medical
  instrumentation systems at significantly reduced size, power, and cost.
