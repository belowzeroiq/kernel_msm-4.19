* Texas Instruments - AFE4403 Heart rate and Pulse Oximeter

The device consists of a low-noise receiver channel
with an integrated analog-to-digital converter (ADC),
an LED transmit section, and diagnostics for sensor and LED fault detection.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Must contain "ti,afe4403".
  - ste-gpio: GPIO for the spi control line
  - data-ready-gpio: GPIO interrupt when the afe4403 has data
  - led-supply: Chip supply to the device

Optional properties:
  - reset-gpio: GPIO used to reset the device via HW

Example:

&heart_rate {
	compatible = "ti,afe4403";
	ste-gpio = <&gpio1 29 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	data-ready-gpio = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	led-supply = <&vbat>;
};
