Description:	read/write
		Writing a 1 to this file will enable the synchronization of all
		the defined color LEDs within the LED node.  Brightness values
		for each LED will be stored and written when sync is set to 1.
		Writing a 0 to this file will disable syncing and allow
		individual control of the LEDs brightness settings.

Description:	write only
		Writing a 1 to this file while sync_enable is set to 1 will
		write the current brightness values to all defined LEDs within
		the LED node.  All LEDs defined will be configured based
		on the brightness that has been requested.

		If sync_enable is set to 0 then writing a 1 to sync has no
		affect on the LEDs.

Description:	read/write
		The led_color directory is dynamically created based on the
		colors defined by the registrar of the class.
		The led_color can be but not limited to red, green, blue,
		white, amber, yellow and violet.  Drivers can also declare a
		LED color for presentation.  There is one directory per color
		presented.  The brightness file is created under each
		led_color directory and controls the individual LED color
		setting.

		If sync is enabled then	writing the brightness value of the LED
		is deferred until a 1 is written to
		/sys/class/leds/<led>/color/sync.  If syncing is
		disabled then the LED brightness value will be written
		immediately to the LED driver.

		The value of the color is from 0 to
		/sys/class/leds/<led>/colors/<led_color>/max_brightness.

Description:	read only
		Maximum brightness level for the LED color, default is
		255 (LED_FULL).

		If the LED does not support different brightness levels, this
		should be 1.
